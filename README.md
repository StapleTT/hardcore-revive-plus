Are you tired of standard Minecraft death mechanics? Maybe dying over and over again just to respawn is too easy, or playing Hardcore mode with one life is too difficult. Hardcore Revive+ solves this problem by adding a highly configurable lives system to your Minecraft world that fits all scenarios.

## Key Features
- Once a player loses all of their lives, they become a ghost. Ghosts are spectators that can generate and load chunks and possess players to grant them buffs.
- You can revive another fallen player by crafting a **Soul Charm** and dropping it on the ground. Once a ghost touches a Soul Charm, they are revived with a set amount of lives.
- Players are able to regain lost lives by consuming a **Life Jam**. You can regain as many lives as you want, as long as you do not go over the maximum.
- When **Auto Revive** is enabled, ghosts can be revived automatically after 10 minutes.
- When **Lifesteal** is enabled, killing another player grants another life.
